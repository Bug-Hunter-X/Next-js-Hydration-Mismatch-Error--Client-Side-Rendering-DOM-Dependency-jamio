# Next.js Hydration Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common hydration mismatch error in Next.js applications.  The error occurs because client-side rendering attempts to access and modify the DOM before the server-rendered content has been fully hydrated. 

## Problem
The `pages/about.js` component attempts to read the text content of an element ("myElement") that's rendered server-side.  Because the client-side rendering happens *after* the server-side rendering, the client-side code tries to access the DOM element before it's fully available, resulting in a hydration mismatch error.  The client and server disagree on the initial state of the DOM. 

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the client-side rendering does not depend on the DOM structure until after hydration is complete. This is typically achieved using techniques such as conditional rendering based on the existence of the DOM element or using refs to access elements after they have been mounted.
